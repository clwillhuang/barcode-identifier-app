# Barrel

This is the website frontend for Barrel (Barcode Reference Library) tool.

Note that the repository is only the frontend portion of the website, and does not include all resources such as scripts and Docker files necessary for deployment.

## Quickstart

After cloning this repository please ensure that the link to the Barrel API that you want to consume is provided as the domain in the [src/url.js file](/src/url.js) file. Note that certain APIs may restrict cross-origin requests from other websites, so using existing APIs hosted by third-parties may not be functional. 

```
npm install
npm run start
```

## Deploying the static website to s3
The following assumes that the React project is located within the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2, with aws installed and configured.
[Instructions for installing AWS CLI are here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

```
# Build the static website
npm run build  
# (optional) Test build on local machine (run 'npm install -g serve' if serve not installed)
serve -s build 
# Upload/Sync with s3
aws s3 sync build/ s3://barcode-identifier
```

On AWS, you can go to S3 > barcode-identifier > properties > static website hosting > bucket website endpoint
